# Wheeled Robot Topologies
_Here are basic wheeled robot topologies_

## Differential Drive

* Easy control
* Ability to turn in place
* problematic over uneven terrain
* Require relatively large turning radius

## Skid Steering

* Opposite rotation of wheels to turn the robot
* Excellent maneuverability
* Capable of navigating uneven terrain
* Quick wear due to sliding
* Hardship in high-speed control

## Ackermann Steering

* Steered front wheel and fixed rear wheels 
* Capable of making sharp turns 
* Good maneuverability 
* Difficulty over uneven terrain

## Mecanum Drive

* Movement withut changing robot orientation (four wheels in criss-cross pattern)
* independently powered wheels
* ability to rotate in place and move diagonally
* Excellent maneuverability
* Expensive and complex compared to other types

## Omnidirectional Drive

* Omnidirectional wheels
* Capable of move in any direction and rotate in place - ideal for complex maneuvers
* Expensive and complex
* Unstable at high speed
