# ROS
_Prepared to give a basis for ROS and ROS-compatibility_

## Hardware Compatibility

* Hardware compotents should be well-supported by ROS, ones with ROS drivers or interfaces

## Communication

* ROS messages should be used to provide communication between distinctive software components of the robot, which are standardized communication protocol

## Use of ROS Packages

* ...

## Software Architecture

* It should be designed in a way that it can be integrated into a ROS-based system

## Integration and Testing

* ...
