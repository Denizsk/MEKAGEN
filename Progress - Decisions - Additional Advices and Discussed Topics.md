## Week 6 (10 Apr - 16 Apr 2023)
### Progress
* Discussion on Robotic Comparison Table is completed. (13 Apr)
* Problem definition and project requirements are presented. (13 Apr)
* Conceptual design ideas on hutplog-robots & payloads are dicussed. (13 Apr)

### Decisions
* Two groups (The Boys and Mekagen) will meet on Sunday, 16 Apr, to discuss on project design concepts. (13 Apr)
* Two groups can also meet in ROMER, and by-time regular-members will granted to an access with their-own ID-card. (13 Apr)
* The robot will have two-wheels, and when it is looked-at there should be no difference as back and front. (13 Apr)
* At the end of the project, when there are readily available two-robots , they should also be combinable; hence, sigma-profiles are of concern (i.e., hotplug). (13 Apr)
* Knowing that encoder is necessary, design of encoder sensors that are suitable for hoverboard-wheel will be searched. Those researches may contain optical, electrical, magnetic sensors but not mechanical as mechanical sensors end up with tearing and wearing. (Any mechanical sensor that will not corrode is also considerable.) (13 Apr)
* Search on battery need is necessary. Battery supply can be met from "Hoverboard Battery" as those are also designed for hoverboard-wheel needs. (13 Apr)
* Literature Survey based on project (two-three wheel adv&dis, suspension, automization) will be searched more. (15 Apr)
* Concepts will be sketched for a better presentation. (15 Apr)

### Additional Advices & Discussed Topics
* Do not only focus on two-wheel hotplug robot concept. Even though the idea may not be adopted, it may help on creative thinking. (13 Apr)
* There are three-wheeled robots in the market, also search for them. (13 Apr)
* Slippage is always a problem in such robots. Mostly, robots even need external reference to know where they exactly at due to cumulative sensor-errors. (13 Apr) 

## Week 5 (3 Apr - 9 Apr 2023)
### Progress
* Preliminary literature survey has been done
* GitHub functionalities have been studied
* Available robots have been analyzed and compared
* Problem definition has been improved

### Decisions
* Gantt chart will be finalized
* Last changes on problem definition are to be done
* Design and project requirements will be determined together with customer expectations.
* A comparison chart will be prepared.
* Mechanical design principal and features will be determined.

## Week 4 (27 Mar - 2 Apr 2023)
### Progress
* First Gantt chart has been prepared.
* First draft of problem definiton has been written.
* Our group now has GitHub Repository
        
### Decisions
* Next week, problem definition will be finalized.
* There will be meetings on weekly basis, on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. and Sundays at 1 p.m.
* Upon need, additional meetings are to be scheduled
