# Design Ideas
_Here we enter our ideat as draft and preliminary work of us._

## Types of Wheels

### Tracked vehicles/Continuous track
* High traction on rough, soft or uneven surface/terrain
* Increased payload capacity in terms of maximum weight
* BUT
* Slow speed compared to other wheel designes due to increase firiction
* High wheel worn and energy consupmtion
* Poor performance on on-road/smooth surfaces in terms of speed, maneuverability, and ride comfort.
* High cost and complexity

### Four-Wheeled
* 

### Three-Wheeled
* ![(a) Two-wheel differential drive, (b) synchronous drive, (c) omnimobile robot with Swedish wheels, (d) omnimobile robot with active caster wheels, and (e) omnidirectional robot with active steerable wheels](three-wheels.png)

### Two-Wheeled
