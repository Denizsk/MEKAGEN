## This file will contain CAD documents that are used during design and manufacture.
### - Some parts of assembly are manufactured by using 3D Printers. Hence, sizes and dimensions may not be fit due to tolerance levels, and may need iterations.
### - Some parts of assembly are manufactured with laser cut machine which is located at ME407 - Lab (G Blobk). Planes and side parts are exported as .dxf and given to operator.
### - Sigma profiles are manufactured with sawing machine in Machine Shop (B Block). The technical drawing of parts printed, signed by A. BuÄŸra KOKU, and delivered to operators with sigma profiles. Note: Sawing machine has a tolerance of 5mm.
