## Cannot be considered as technical drawings... But we used them anyway... 
## During the first design steps, we though that it would be enough to have a 80mm height between floors, yet it seem be to be a little bit inconvient for changing electronic parts on floors. Hence, lately it is decided to have 100mm height between floors but 80mm.
# In order to built a robot;
## 1) 250mm - 30 Deg. (18 Pieces)
## 2) 100mm - 90 Deg. (Cut straight) - (6 Pieces)
## 3) 120 Deg. Sigma Profile Connector x 18 (To be bought - We bought from Doğus Kalıp)
## 4) 90 Deg. Connectors (2 for each 100mm parts)
## 5) Do NOT forget to insert TNuts during assembly :) (There are two types of TNuts we have encountered. The ones that can be inserted during assembly process and cannot be took off without disassembly and the ones that are insertable to already built robot. - Make sure to check which one you possess.)
## Insertable TNuts:

## Noninsertable and make you cry TNuts:
